# Configuring Lifecycle Services
Lifecycle Services is a key tool for Dynamics 365.  It stores all the project information including the methodologies and templates to help you along the way.
To make the most out of it though we will want to configure a few extra bells and whistles including connecting it to SharePoint for document management, linking it with Visual Studio Online so that we can track issues there, and also configuring the Business Process Models so that we can take advantage of the task guides and help.
