# Creating a new Worker Record for the Admin User
### A person’s name is the sweetest sound- Dale Carnegie 
When the Dynamics 365 tenant is first created, the default Admin user is connected to the Julia Funderburk worker account.  Although this may be OK for some people, it’s definitely nicer to have our own name showing up against the user.But before we can do that we will need to create a worker account for our new user.

## How to do it…

To do this type in workers into the search field at the top of the page and Dynamics 365 will show you all of the menu items that match.  All you need to do here is find the Human Resources Workers menu item and click on it.

This will open the Workers list page and all we need to do here is click on the New button in the menu bar.

This will open the Create new worker panel where we can specify our new worker and hire them.

Start off by typing in the First name of our new worker.

Then type in the Last name of the worker.

That is all we need to get hired, and we can click on the Hire and add details button.

Now we have a new Worker record for ourselves.

Before we finish though we will want to add a little more information so that we can use our worker.Expand out the Contact Information tab so that we can add the email address.

Now we will want to add a new Email address for our worker.To do this click on the Add button within the Contact Information tab group.

Then set the Description to Email.

Next click on the dropdown list for the Type and select the Email address option.

Now we will want to type in our users’ tenant email address into the Contact number/address field.

And then check on the Primary checkbox to say that this is the main email address that we will be wanting to use.After we have done that, click on the Advanced button.

This will open the Edit contact information panel for us with a couple of other options.

Here we will want to set the Instant message switch to Yes to enable our worker’s Skype integration.

And also, we will want to set the Instant messenger sign in switch to Yes as well to tell the system that this is the account that we will be signing into Skype with as well.After we have done that we can just click on the OK button and close out of the form.
