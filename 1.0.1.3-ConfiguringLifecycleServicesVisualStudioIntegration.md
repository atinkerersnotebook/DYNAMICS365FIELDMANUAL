# Configuring Lifecycle Services Visual Studio Integration
Within Lifecycle Services you can create a connection to Visual Studio Team Services.  This will allow you to link your support tickets to Visual Studio and track all of the tasks associated with them through Visual Studio Online.

## How to do it…

### Step 1: Click on the Setup Visual Studio Team Services button
To do this we just need to open our Lifecycle Services project that was we used to create our Dynamics 365 instance.  In the Action Center there will be a reminder to configure the Visual Studio Team Services connection.So all we need to do here is to start configuring the Visual Studio Team Services (Azure Dev Ops).To do this all we need to do is click on the Setup Visual Studio Team Services button.

This will open the Setup Visual Studio Team Services wizard for us to start the process, and all we need to do here is to enter in the Azure DevOps (a.k.a. Visual Studio Team Services) site URL and the Personal Access Token.We will want to find the URL for our Azure DevOps project before we can move on from here.

### Step 2: Click on the Sign In button
To get that information and to also create a Personal Access Token, open your Visual Studio Online account and select the visual studio project that you want to connect LCS to.If we do not have a Visual Studio project, then just open the Visual Studio website.Once we are on the Azure DevOps site we will be able to sign in.To do this all we need to do is click on the Sign In button.

![If we do not have a Visual Studio project, then just open the Visual Studio website.](images/image_24.png)

### Step 3: Click on the Continue button
If this is the first time that we are connecting with Azure DevOps then we will be asked for some more information to set up the development environment.We can accept the defaults here if we are logged in with our tenants credentials.To do this just click on the Continue button.

### Step 4: Click on the Create new organization button
This will take us to our profile page within Azure DevOps.For new users, we will want to create a new organization that we will use to track our tasks from Lifecycle Services.To do this just click on the Create new organization button.

![This will take us to our profile page within Azure DevOps.](images/image_26.png)

### Step 5: Click on the Continue button
This will open a consent dialog box.We just need to accept the terms before continuing on.To do this all we need to do is click on the Continue button.

![This will open a consent dialog box.](images/image_27.png)

Now we will be asked to select a unique organization name for our Azure DevOps organization.

### Step 6: Update the Name your Azure DevOps oranization
We can keep the default organization Id that Azure DevOps suggests for us, or we can change it to something a little more personal.To make things a little more transparent, just in case we create multiple environments that have to be linked with multiple Azure DevOps organizations, we will update the organization name to match the environment that it will be connected with.To do this we will just need to update the Name your Azure DevOps oranization value.This time, we will want to set the Name your Azure DevOps oranization to mufifemsd365demo1.

This will open the project creation form for our organization.

![This will open the project creation form for our organization.](images/image_30.png)

### Step 7: Update the Project name and click on the Create project button
Now we will want to create a project within the Azure DevOps organization that we will be able to link with Lifecycle Services.To do this just change the Project name value and click on the Create project button.This time, we will want to set the Project name to Mufife D365 Demo.

![](images/image_31.png)

This will create a new Visual Studio project for us.To get that information and to also create a Personal Access Token, open your Visual Studio Online account and select the visual studio project that you want to connect LCS to.

![This will create a new Visual Studio project for us.](images/image_32.png)

### Step 8: Click on Profile icon and click select Personal access tokens
Now we need to create an Access Token that Lifecycle Services will use to link to the Azure DevOps project.To do this all we need to do is click on the Profile icon and click on the Personal access tokens option.

![](images/image_33.png)

### Step 9: Click on the New Token button
This will take us to the Security options for the project and we will be able to see the Personal Access Tokens tab is already selected.From here we will just request a new Personal access token.To do this just click on the New Token button.

![](images/image_34.png)

This will open the Create a new personal access token dialog box.This will open the option for you to create a personal access token.

![This will open the Create a new personal access token dialog box.](images/image_35.png)

### Step 10: Update the Name
We will want to start off by giving our Personal access token an unique name.To do this we will just need to update the Name value.For this example, we will want to set the Name to MuFife D365 Demo.

![](images/image_36.png)

### Step 11: Choose the Expriration (UTC)
By default, the tokens default to expire in 30 days.We will want to make this token last a little longer so that we don’t have to continually renew the token.To do this just pick the Expriration (UTC) value from the dropdown list.For this example, we will want to click on the Expriration (UTC) dropdown list and pick Custom defined.

Now that we have a custom defined expiration date set, we can manually specify the expiration date of the token.

### Step 12: Click on the Calendar button and update the Expriration Date
We will now want to select the expiration date.We cannot select any date in the future – there is a limit of one year for the access tokens.  So we will want to select the latest date possible in the calendar.To do this all we need to do is click on the Calendar button and update the Expriration Date value.For this example, we will want to set the Expriration Date to Latest possible date.

![We will now want to select the expiration date.](images/image_39.png)

Now the token will expire in a year.Next we will want to select the scope of the tokens privileges.

![Now the token will expire in a year.](images/image_40.png)

### Step 13: Update the Scope and click on the Create button
We can select the individual rights if we want.For this token though we will want to give it access to all of the Azure DevOps functions so we will just give it Full Access and then create the token.To do this we will just need to update the Scope value and click on the Create button.This time, we will want to set the Scope to Full access.

![](images/image_41.png)

### Step 14: Click Copy to clipboard and click Close
This will then return us to the Personal Access Tokens page and we will see that a new token has been created for us.Copy the token that is generated, because we will need it in the next step.To do this all we need to do is click on the Copy to clipboard button and click on the Close button.

![Copy the token that is generated, because we will need it in the next step.](images/image_42.png)

Now we will have a Full Access Personal Token.Now we can just exit from the User settings form.

![Now we will have a Full Access Personal Token.](images/image_43.png)

When we return to the Azure DevOps organization page we will see that we have a new project.Now we can link the project to our Lifecycle Services project.

![When we return to the Azure DevOps organization page we will see that we have a new project.](images/image_44.png)

return to the Lifecycle Services project that we were originally working on.

### Step 15: Update the Azure DevOps site URL and click on the Continue button
Now we can update the project URL into the Visual Studio Team Services site URL field.Note that the URL needs to have the visualstudio.com extension, not the DevOps extension.To do this we will just need to update the Azure DevOps site URL value and click on the Continue button.For this example, we will want to set the Azure DevOps site URL to https://mufifemsd365demo1.visualstudio.com.

![](images/image_46.png)

Next we will be asked for the Personal access token.

![Next we will be asked for the Personal access token.](images/image_47.png)

### Step 16: Update the Personal access token
To do this we will just need to update the Personal access token value and then click on the Continue button.For this example, we will want to paste the Personal access token from our clipboard.

![](images/image_48.png)

Now that our project is linked to Azure DevOps we will move to the next step of selecting the project.This will take us to the next step in the process which is to select the project that we want to connect Lifecycle Services to.

![Now that our project is linked to Azure DevOps we will move to the next step of selecting the project.](images/image_49.png)

### Step 17: Update the Visual Studio Team Services project
We should be able to select our Azure DevOps project that we created in the previous steps.To do this we will just need to update the Visual Studio Team Services project value.For this example, we will want to set the Visual Studio Team Services project to MuFife D365 Demo.

![](images/image_50.png)

### Step 18: Click on the Continue button
When the project is selected, we will then be able to continue on.To do this all we need to do is click on the Continue button.

![](images/image_51.png)

That will take us to the Review stage and all we need to do here is make sure everything is still correct and then click on the Save button.

![](images/image_52.png)

### Step 19: Click on the Save button
We can scroll down and see all of the items that will be integrated between Lifecycle Services and Azure DevOps.When we are ready, we can then finish linking the services together.To do this just click on the Save button.

![](images/image_53.png)

This will return us to the main dashboard for Lifecycle Services and the requirement to link Visual Studio to Lifecycle services will disappear and we are done.

## Summary

Now that we have Visual Studio Team Services connected with Lifecycle Services all of the support tickets that are entered into Lifecycle Services will be created as tasks within Visual Studio Online.  This is super useful because you don’t want to have to go to Lifecycle Services all of the time to see the issues and then manually create the tasks in Visual Studio.  Also there are a lot more tools available within Visual Studio that you can take advantage of for managing the work items from a development standpoint.  Also developers like Visual Studio, so this will keep them happy.
