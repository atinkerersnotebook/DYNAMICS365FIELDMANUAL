# Assigning your user a Position
One last thing that we will want to do is to assign a position to our new worker.  This will also be shown on the Employee Self Service portal.  Depending on the position that we choose we may also have employees that report to us. Rather than create a new position though we will save a little bit of time and assign our user an existing position.

## How to do it…

To do this type in workers into the search field at the top of the page and Dynamics 365 will show you all of the menu items that match.  All you need to do here is find the Workers menu item and click on it.

This will open a list of all the workers that are configured within the system.

Within the Workers Search box type in Sara and find Sara Thomas’s employee record.  Unfortunately it looks like she is going to have a lot of free time on her hands.  From here, click on the End Assignment menu item within the Position Assignment button group.

This will open the End the Position Assignment side panel.

Change the Assignment End date to be some time in the past.

Then click on the Retire Worker Assignment button.

This will remove the position from Sarah’s worker record and make it available to be assigned to another worker.

Now search through the workers and find your demo worker that you just created.

Then click on the Add assignment button within the Position Assignment button group.

This will open the Create a Position Assignment side panel.

Now we can type in the Position that  we just made available by firing Sara.

And then check the Make Primary option before clicking on the Create position assignment button.

When we return to our demo worker we will see that they now have the new position assigned to them

When we look at the Employee Self Service workspace we will see that the position shows up there now.

As a bonus when we open the Manager Self Service workspace we will see that we have direct reports.
